## Background

2020 was a difficult year for everyone around the world due to the Coronavirus pandemic. During the initial months of the pandemic we knew very little about the virus,how it spread and the potential treatments that could be used against it. We saw reports of medical infrastructure getting overburdened and high fatality rates across the globe due to lack of proper treatments for the virus. As time went on we kept learning more about the virus & the entire scientific & medical community got together to find ways of overcoming the virus. Among many things that came out, ones that I found particularly interesting were articles being published around negative correlation between BCG vaccination prevalence within a country & fatality rates from the virus. At the same time University of Ottawa & Estafet launched a [hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/bcgvaccine/hackathon/tasks?taskId=1027) on Kaggle to study this problem statement in more detail. The notebook below includes code for my submission for the hackathon, which won the first prize.
